# Weather App using Flutter

This Flutter application fetches weather data from a free API (MetaWeather API) based on user-selected cities. It displays current weather information and a 7-day forecast.

## Features

- Display current temperature, weather state, humidity, wind speed, and weather icon.
- Select a city from a dropdown menu to fetch weather data.
- Display a 7-day forecast with weather details for each day.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gautamraj5488/weather_app
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd weather_flutter
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the app:**

   Ensure you have an emulator running or a device connected.

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Usage

- Upon launching the app, it will initially fetch weather data for the default city (Delhi).
- Use the dropdown menu in the app bar to select a different city.
- The app will update the weather information based on the selected city.

## API Integration

- **MetaWeather API** is used to fetch weather data:
    - Location search: `https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/search/?query={query}`
    - Weather information: `https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/{woeid}/`

  Replace `{query}` with the city name and `{woeid}` with the Where On Earth ID obtained from the location search.

## Libraries Used

- `http`: for making HTTP requests to the MetaWeather API.
- `intl`: for date formatting.
- `json`: for parsing JSON data.
